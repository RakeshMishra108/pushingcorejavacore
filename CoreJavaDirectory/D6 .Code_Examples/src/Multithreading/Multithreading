Intro -> 
	#involves multiple tasks running simultaneously
	#Generic terminology has 2 forms => Multiprocessing and Multithreading
	MultiProcessing -- 
	#'program' set of instructions and process is a 'Running Instance of a Program'.CPU is shared between 2 processes.
	#OS implements Context Switching mechanism
	#Program's entire context including variables,global variables,objects etc., is stored separately.
	Multithreading --
	#Different tasks within a main task execute simultaneously
	#implements the idea of Multitasking by taking it one level lower.
	#A thread is an entity within a process
	#it defines the path of execution

Implementing Multithreading--
	#to implement multithreading Java provides an API from java.lang package;
	#A 'Thread' class and a 'Runnable' interface
	#It is necessary to create a Java class which is referred as a thread implementation class.
	#it must either 'extends Thread' or 'implements Runnable'
	#all thread implementation classes define a 'run()' methiod which provides logic for the thread or acts as a gateway to the logic.
	#Multithreaded programs are platform dependent
